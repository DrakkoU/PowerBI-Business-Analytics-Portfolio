Power BI Business Analytics Portfolio

Introduction
This repository contains a portfolio of interactive Power BI dashboards built to solve strategic business problems. Each project demonstrates a full workflow: from data modeling and complex DAX calculations to interactive dashboard design and actionable insight generation.

The focus is on transforming raw data into clear, executive-level narratives for finance, operations, and product strategy.
